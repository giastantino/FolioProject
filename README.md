# Portfolio Project

In this repository I build, update and present my Portfolio Project.

**Project's task** is to create a small and naive contract recommendation system. It should help bank employees in proposing offers to new clients.

To accomplish this task I separated this process into smaller parts:

1. Notebooks:
✔️  Clustering bank statistics data into marketing segments
✔️  Predicting client segment based on demographics
⭕  Neural Network model classifying clients into clusters with statistics
2. Database:
✔️  Build initial database with MySQL
⭕  Expand it to allow App and Database communication
3. Web App:
⭕  Build the App using ![Strimlit](https://streamlit.io)
⭕  Enable App and Database cloud communication

***

The main **purpose of this repository** is to present my skills in:
🐍 python and jupyter
📊 data visualization: plotly and matplotlib
🦾 machine learning: sklearn and torch
💾 data management: pandas and SQL
