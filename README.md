# Portfolio Project

**Project's task** is to create a small contract recommendation system. It should help bank's employees in proposing offers to new clients.

To accomplish this task, I have broken this process down into smaller parts:

1. **Notebooks**:

✔️  Clustering bank statistics data into marketing segments

✔️  Predicting client segment based on demographics

⭕  Neural Network model classifying clients into clusters with statistics


2. **Web App**:

⭕  Build the App using [Strimlit](https://streamlit.io)


***

The main **purpose of this repository** is to present my skills in:

🐍 python and jupyter

📊 data visualization: plotly and matplotlib

🦾 machine learning: sklearn and torch
